# Pronote Mobile (React Native)

This directory contains a simple React Native application using Expo. The app allows students to log in with their ENT credentials and will later provide notification support when new grades are detected via `pronote-tools`.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js and Expo CLI installed.
2. Run `npm install` inside this directory.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. Optionally run `node server.js` to start the local API bridging to Python scripts from `pronote-tools`.

## Important

This project relies on thirdâ€‘party services (PRONOTE and related ENT providers). Make sure to review and comply with their respective terms of service before using this code in production.
